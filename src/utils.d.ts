/**
 * With a passed function â€” will start a span, and run the function, when the function finishes
 * the span finishes.
 *
 * The measure method will return whatever the function is, so if it's a promise, it returns a
 * promise and so on. Any error is caught and re thrown, and automatically tracked in the
 * context under the `error` property.
 *
 * All promises are tracked, and awaited on a `tracer.end`.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```text
 * const data = await measure(scope, 'name', get_data, 'user_id_123');
 *        ^                    ^      ^       ^          ^
 *        |                    |      |       |          |
 *        |                    |      |       |          the first argument to get_data
 *        |                    |      |       function to be called
 *        |                    |      the name of the sub scope
 *        |                    |
 *        |                    the parent scope
 *         return value from get_data
 * ```
